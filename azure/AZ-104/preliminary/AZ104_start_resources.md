Azure PowerShell is also available two ways: 
- Inside a browser via the **Azure Cloud Shell**.
- With a **local installation** on Linux, macOS, or the Windows operating system.

Two modes: 
- interactive mode: manually issue one command at a time
- scripting mode: execute a script that consists of multiple commands.

## Az Module

Features:

- Resources groups
- Storage
- VMs
- Azure AD

# Azure CLI 
Azure CLI is a command-line program to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources.

Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and allows administrators and developers to execute their commands through a terminal, command-line prompt, or script instead of a web browser. 

Example
```sh
az vm restart -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm
```

Provides cross-platform command-line tools for managing Azure resources.

Can be used:

- Interactive mode: manually issue one command at a time
- Scripting mode: execute a script that consists of multiple commands.

Features:
