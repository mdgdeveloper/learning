# General

Cloud computing refers to the usage of computing resources (servers) on the internet (refers to the term cloud) for the purpose of storing, managing, analyzing, and processing the data. Here, instead of maintaining our own servers, we use the infrastructure provided and maintained by third-party vendors such as Microsoft, AWS, etc, and pay them based on the server usage time duration.
Cloud computing enhances the speed of execution, ensures flexibility of resources, and easier scalability.
Cloud computing can be used to attain high fault tolerance and high system availability and this can also be done dynamically as per the infrastructural requirements of the application.
