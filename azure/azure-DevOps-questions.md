# Azure DevOps

1. What is DevOps?

DevOps is Development and Operation’s Collaboration, it’s a Union of 3Ps - Process, People and Product (working Product) that enable continuous integration and continuous delivery of value to our end users. DevOps accelerate the process to deliver applications and software services at high speed and high velocity. So that organization can learn and adopt to the market at its earliest. Also, it minimizing the risk factor by continuously delivering and getting end users and stakeholders feedback at the early stages.

2. What is need for DevOps?

In Traditional software development, after completing the development part, the code deployment time was huge. And many times, we heard the common fights between the Development Team and Operations Team or deployment team that it works fine on our system, it's the sever causing problem and operation team defenses it's not your server it's your code, Right? Well, DevOps solves the Traditional Dev and Ops fights by breaking the wall of confusion.

3. How DevOps works?

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers that work together in the entire project lifecycle, from the design and development process to production releases and support.

Starting from design and development to testing automation and from continuous integration to continuous delivery, the team works together to achieve the desired goal. People having both development and operations skill sets working together and use various tools for CI-CD and Monitoring to respond quickly to customer's need and fix issues and bugs.

22. What is the difference between Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server?

This is one of the trickier Azure DevOps interview questions. Azure DevOps Services is the cloud service of Microsoft Azure and it offers a highly scalable and reliable hosted service that is globally available. DevOps Server, on the other hand, is an on-premise offering that is on a SQL Server back end.

Enterprises go for the on-premise offering when they want their day within their network or when there is a requirement for accessing SQL Server reporting services that are integrated with Azure DevOps data and tools.

23. What are the different DevOps solution architectures?

Multiple tools and technologies can be leveraged with Azure to design solution architectures for the below DevOps scenarios:

- CI/CD for Azure VMs
- CI/CD for Azure Web Apps
- CI/CD for containers
- DevTest image factory
- Using Azure Web Apps and Jenkins for Java CI/CD
- Using Jenkins and Terraform on Azure Virtual Architecture for immutable infrastructure CI/CD
- Using Jenkins and Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service for Container CI/CD

24. What are the reasons to use CI and CD and Azure pipelines?

Make sure to go through this question as it is one of the important interview questions. Implementing CI and CD pipelines ensures quality and reliable code.

Azure pipelines are there to ensure a secure, easy, and quick way to automate processes for project development as well as their availability. They are completely free for use in public projects and cost-effective for private ones (free 30 hours per month).

Below are a few reasons for using CI/CD and Azure pipelines:

- Supports any platform or language
- Enables work with open-source project>
- Building on Windows, Mac, and Linux machines
- Enables simultaneous deployment to various types of a target
- Integration with GitHub and Azure deployments

25. What should you do to make a NuGet package available to anonymous users outside your organization alongside minimizing the number of publication points?

The answer is the introduction of a new feed for the package. Packages that are hosted in Azure Artifacts, find storage in a feed. Sharing packages with higher scalability and according to requirements can be ensured by setting up permissions on the feed. These multiple feeds enable control of access to packages across four levels. These four levels of access are:

- Owners
- Readers
- Contributors
- Collaborators

26. How can you enable communication between members of the development team working in different locations around the world using Azure DevOps?

For such an application, the isolation of members of different project teams into different communication channels is the first criterion. Additionally, maintaining communication history in the concerned channels is necessary. Effective integration with Azure DevOps is also important for the application and allows one to add external suppliers and contractors to projects. The Microsoft teams have addressed these requirements through their offering of the right capabilities.

Classifying teams allows the creation of different channels by users for the organization of communications according to the topic. Every channel can include a few to thousands of users.

Microsoft Teams provides a guest access feature that allows the invitation of external people to join internal channels for the purpose of meetings, file sharing, and messaging. It helps in B2B project management and can also directly integrate with Azure DevOps.

27. Which feature can be used for the development of a multi-tier application using Azure App Service web apps as the front end and Azure SQL database as the back end?

The appropriate option, in this case, is Application Map in Azure Application Insights. This is because it helps in identifying the performance bottlenecks as well as the failure hotspots in different components of the multi-tier applications.

Application components and the related dependencies are represented by the nodes on the map. Furthermore, it is also capable of providing the status for health KPI and alerts.

28. What can you do to improve the quality of code if there are many unused variables and empty catch blocks?

Selecting “Run PMD” in a Maven build task will do the trick. PMD is a source code analyzer that is capable of identifying common programming errors like unnecessary object creation, unused variables, and empty code blocks.

An Apache Maven PMD Plugin will automatically run the tool on a project’s source code and the detailed code error results are provided on the site report.

29. What are the necessary components for the integration of Azure DevOps and Bitbucket?

The integration of Azure DevOps and Bitbuckets requires a self-hosted agent and an external Git service connection. Since GitLab CI/CD is compatible with GitHub and Bitbucket. Instead of moving an entire project to GitLab, it is possible to connect the external repository. One can make use of GitLab CI/CD in this manner.

30. Explain Pair Programming with reference to DevOps.

Pair programming is an engineering practice of Extreme Programming Rules. It involves two programmers working on the same system and on the same design/code/algorithm.

One programmer can be the driver and the other as the observer and constantly monitor the progress of a project and identify problems. The roles can be removed at any moment without prior intimation.
