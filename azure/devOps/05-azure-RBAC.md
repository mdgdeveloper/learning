# Azure RBAC - Role Based Access Control
Azure RBAC is an authorization system that helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to.

To create a **role assignment** you need three elements:
**1. Security principal (Who?)**
    Defines who is going to get the access: user, group, service principal and managed identity.

**2. Role Definition (What?)**
    A collection of permissions, i.e.: read, write, delete. Roles can be high-level, like *Owner*, or specfici, like *Virtual Machine Contributor*

**3. Scope (Where?)**
    Set of resources on which access will be applied.
